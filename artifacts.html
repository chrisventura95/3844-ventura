                    <h3>T-Shaped Essay</h3>
                      <p>This podcast reflects the T part of the VT-shaped
                        student model through its investigations. In the
                        podcast, the investigator is interested in the T-shaped
                        student concept. While the investigator conducts
                        some research about its general purpose, his
                        understanding is enhanced when he interviews
                        two Virginia Tech students who know all about
                        the criteria of the T-shaped concept. Through
                        the interviews, the investigator begins to
                        understand what makes a student T-shaped at
                        Virginia Tech.</p>
                      <p>During the first interview, the student
                        mentions classes she is currently taking,
                        including Writing and Editing for PR, PR Cases,
                        and Writing and Digital Media. Any student can
                        take classes – that is what makes one a student.
                        However, it is what she says next that
                        exemplifies the T-shaped concept. The student
                        notes that the exposure to technology is
                        important for liberal arts students. While
                        she acknowledges that liberal arts is not
                        particularly centered on creating websites or
                        engineering, she notes the importance of
                        technology curricula merging with humanistic
                        curricula. At Virginia Tech, students should
                         be familiar with both in order to succeed and
                         create worthwhile content.</p>
                      <p>The same can be said for the interview
                        between the investigator and a second student.
                        While this student takes classes with a
                        liberal arts focus, she also takes classes
                        with a technology focus. Utilizing both areas,
                        she effectively creates content that can be
                        accessed by a wide variety of audiences.
                        As a T-shaped student at Virginia Tech,
                        she is aware that her skills in content
                        producing should not be aimed at one particular
                        group of people. By using both humanistic
                        curricula and technology curricula, she has
                        become a versatile student with a unique set
                        of skills.</p>
                      <p>Through out the podcast, the investigator
                        gains more and more knowledge on the T-shaped
                        student. By interviewing students that represent
                        the T-shaped concept at Virginia Tech, the
                        investigator realizes the importance of combining
                        curricula for the benefit of students as well as
                        education as a whole.</p>

                    <h2>V-Shaped Student</h2>
                    <h3>V-Shaped Video</h3>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y9VfKEHw4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <h3>V-Shaped Essay</h3>
                      <p>This video reflects the V part of the VT-shaped
                        student model through its emphasis on extracurricular
                        activities. In the video, the
                        professor is selfish; he fails to understand the
                        importance of education outside of the classroom.
                        The professor believes that classes, and classes alone,
                        prepare students for a successful future. As he learns
                        through out the video, this is simply not the case.</p>
                      <p>The professor is frustrated that his student is
                        employed at the university’s Human Resources department.
                        He is so frustrated that he believes she is wasting her
                        time at the department and not putting enough effort in
                        his class. The student does not even have time to argue
                        her case before the professor kicks her out of his
                        office.</p>
                      <p>At the HR department, the student’s boss states
                        that they give her hands-on experience she could not
                        receive in the classroom. While the classroom delivers
                        PowerPoint slides and note-taking opportunities,
                        the boss reminds the student that they give her
                        access to InDesign and Hootsuite, as well as an
                        opportunity to create her own PowerPoints for
                        distribution to Virginia Tech employees.
                        As exemplified by the V-shaped concept, students gain
                        unique experiences by interning and serving their
                        communities.</p>
                      <p>It is not until the student and her boss revisit
                        the professor’s office that he finally understands the
                        importance of internships. While class-facilitated
                        notes, tests, and exams are valuable, there is
                        nothing wrong with students expanding their educational
                        opportunities through internships. By the end,
                        the professor is willing to “share” his student with
                        other organizations, as long as she continues her
                        learning. As the video exemplifies, V-shaped students
                        recognize the value in extracurriculars and actively
                        pursue them in an attempt to gain as much knowledge
                        as possible while still giving back to society.</p>

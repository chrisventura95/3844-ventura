                    <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/313796572&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

                    <h3>T-Shaped Essay</h3>
                      <p>This podcast reflects the T part of the VT-shaped
                        student model through its investigations. In the
                        podcast, the investigator is interested in the T-shaped
                        student concept. While the investigator conducts
                        some research about its general purpose, his
                        understanding is enhanced when he interviews
                        two Virginia Tech students who know all about
                        the criteria of the T-shaped concept. Through
                        the interviews, the investigator begins to
                        understand what makes a student T-shaped at
                        Virginia Tech.</p>
                      <p>During the first interview, the student
                        mentions classes she is currently taking,
                        including Writing and Editing for PR, PR Cases,
                        and Writing and Digital Media. Any student can
                        take classes â€“ that is what makes one a student.
                        However, it is what she says next that
                        exemplifies the T-shaped concept. The student
                        notes that the exposure to technology is
                        important for liberal arts students. While
                        she acknowledges that liberal arts is not
                        particularly centered on creating websites or
                        engineering, she notes the importance of
                        technology curricula merging with humanistic
                        curricula. At Virginia Tech, students should
                         be familiar with both in order to succeed and
                         create worthwhile content.</p>
                      <p>The same can be said for the interview
                        between the investigator and a second student.
                        While this student takes classes with a
                        liberal arts focus, she also takes classes
                        with a technology focus. Utilizing both areas,
                        she effectively creates content that can be
                        accessed by a wide variety of audiences.
                        As a T-shaped student at Virginia Tech,
                        she is aware that her skills in content
                        producing should not be aimed at one particular
                        group of people. By using both humanistic
                        curricula and technology curricula, she has
                        become a versatile student with a unique set
                        of skills.</p>
                      <p>Through out the podcast, the investigator
                        gains more and more knowledge on the T-shaped
                        student. By interviewing students that represent
                        the T-shaped concept at Virginia Tech, the
                        investigator realizes the importance of combining
                        curricula for the benefit of students as well as
                        education as a whole.</p>

                          I work as a technical writing intern at Network Infrastructure &amp; Services.
                          I read documents, give them appropriate labels, and organize them within a wiki database.
                        <li>
                          My internship relates to digital writing because I am creating and editing content and putting it online.

                          My internship relates to the VT-shaped student through the "T" and "V" shapes: I am learning how to be
                          technologically proficient through my internship, which is a form of experiential learning.

                          I am a creative writer major. When I'm sad about girls, I wrote poetry in a little composition notebook.
                          I also write comedy scripts for the Filipino American Student Association's culture shows.
                        <li>
                          This relates to digital media because I can potentially upload this content online using HTML.
                        <li>
                          My creative writing skills relate to the vertical portion of VT knowledge: departmental/disciplinary strengths.
                          The creative writing department has a versatile set of strengths, from writing short stories to poetry
                          to creative non-fiction to literary analysis. Through the department's many resources, students such as myself
                          have developed their own creative writing strengths and applied them outside of the classroom.

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I enjoy attending read-outs hosted by the English department. This includes events featuring the work of fellow
                          students as well as guest speakers. It is such a unique experience learning from peers and role models.
                          Everybody has something interesting to say about the lives they live.
                        <li>
                          This relates to digital media because I can potentially upload my own work, a reflection of my peer's work,
                          or reflection of a guest speaker's work online using HTML.
                        <li>
                          This relates to the VT-shaped student because read-outs can be considered student-life opportunities, which
                          are mentioned in the "V" shape. By developing and sharing their work, students observe and attempt to
                          understand one another artistically. Read-outs encourage learning outside of the classroom as
                          students come together and participate in social engagement.

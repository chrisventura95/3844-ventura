                      digital Utopia."

                      upon the culture around us and makes it something
                      different."

                      the world education system, will supply the humanity of
                      the days before us, with a common understanding and the
                      conception of a common purpose and of a commonweal such
                      as now we hardly dare dream of. 
                    <h2>To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to
                      remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both
                      inspiration and imagination ... technology never works
                      without people as part of the equation, because innovation
                      is fundamentally a human pursuit. </h2>

                      science as Galileo did, and from science to art as Leonardo

VERSE 1
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a year ago
Class up in Shanks, and we workshop every Tuesday so
Reading stories, bro, was my favorite thing
Made me analyze, like, I don’t know, speak my mind critiquing
Now I like to sing
A different song, cause now I’m a coder
Girl why are you cheating, looking over my shoulder?
Get your own HTML to put in your folder
Used to write free form poems, use Markdown cause I’m older
Yeah, I learned to make websites, now my mind is much golder
Left arrow, b, right arrow to make a word bolder
“My God you major in English?” I take that as a compliment
Last year couldn’t code, this year it’s the opposite
Earning cash ain’t the half of it
Weekdays making huge stacks of it
Entry-level job with a desk and a cabinet (whoa)
Sorry, I’m just proud of my major
Till 3009 I’ll represent VT-shaped student, hold up

CHORUS (x2)
No matter what you learn or what you take
When we’re at home, code is what we make
Screw these other majors, I think English is fine
Till 3009, hold up

VERSE 2
I used to do liberal arts
But now I do more, I mean T-shaped concept says use technology
So therefore, I’ve combined art and website creating
Making content that appeals to audiences
Of all different backgrounds, it’s obvious
We write it, like Whitman
We type it, in Atom
We upload, in Github
We smart like, the chess club
And when class is done, I still get to have fun
Cause I got my internship, son, at NIS I learn a ton
And no matter where my coworkers be, Julia, Ludwig and Maddy,
All of them people teaching me
Experience, see?
Hands-on
Cause V-shaped students, they’re prudent,
They use class and
Internships to succeed in life, I’ll get a wife
Who is nice and won’t have to work or budget like
Middle class guys, I’m glad I chose this life, I mean it
Even in this rap I get critical
Against standards, not typical, I’m speculative
Abstract, even if you don’t get it, hold up

CHORUS (x2)
No matter what you learn or what you take
When we’re at home, code is what we make
Screw these other majors, I think English is fine
Till 3009, hold up

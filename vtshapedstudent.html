                    <h2>VT-Shaped Essay</h2>
                      <p>This rap song reflects the VT-shaped student model in
                        various ways. The verses tell the story of an English
                        student who possesses the knowledge to write HTML,
                        use Atom, and use GitHub. With this knowledge, the
                        student is confident he will succeed in life. By
                        exploring the addition of technology curricula into
                        his learning, as well as his internship experience,
                        the rap song reflects the VT-shaped student model
                        while offering a critique on past stereotypes of the
                        liberal arts student.
                      <p>The student looks back on his prior workload, which
                        consisted of literature workshops. While he enjoyed
                        his liberal curricula, the student acknowledges that
                        a lot has changed since then: he has picked up coding
                        lessons and implements them in his work. Through this
                        combination of arts and technology, the student
                        exemplifies the T-shaped concept. Additionally,
                        the student has gained experience at his internship,
                        where he now has hands-on experience that enhances his
                        learning opportunities. This aligns with the V-shaped
                        concept, and with all of this taken together, the
                        student successfully possesses the abilities of a
                        VT-shaped student.
                      <p>In terms of critical design, the student questions
                        the negative stereotypes linked to English students.
                        Prior to learning about coding, the student was at a
                        loss because he only possessed humanistic knowledge.
                        Furthermore, peers would mock him for being an English
                        major. Thanks to the implementation of the VT-shaped
                        student, English majors are now instilled with
                        confidence to live successful and wealthy lives as
                        they create versatile content.
                      <p>Thanks to the VT-shaped student the liberal arts department has gained a better reputation and better-prepared students. The implementation of useful technology has endowed students with the skillset needed to strive in our advancing society.

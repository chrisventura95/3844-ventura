                    <p>When I'm not out making a name for myself in the rap game,
                    I'm pursuing my other interests:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Technical writing</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I work as a technical writing intern at Network Infrastructure &amp; Services.
                          I read documents, give them appropriate labels, and organize them within a wiki database.
                        <li>
                          My internship relates to digital writing because I am creating and editing content and putting it online.
                        <li>
                          My internship relates to the VT-shaped student through the "T" and "V" shapes: I am learning how to be
                          technologically proficient through my internship, which is a form of experiential learning.
                      </ul>
                    <li><b>Creative writing</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I am a creative writer major. When I'm sad about girls, I wrote poetry in a little composition notebook.
                          I also write comedy scripts for the Filipino American Student Association's culture shows.
                        <li>
                          This relates to digital media because I can potentially upload this content online using HTML.
                        <li>
                          My creative writing skills relate to the vertical portion of VT knowledge: departmental/disciplinary strengths.
                          The creative writing department has a versatile set of strengths, from writing short stories to poetry
                          to creative non-fiction to literary analysis. Through the department's many resources, students such as myself
                          have developed their own creative writing strengths and applied them outside of the classroom.
                      </ul>
                    <li><b>Read-outs</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I enjoy attending read-outs hosted by the English department. This includes events featuring the work of fellow
                          students as well as guest speakers. It is such a unique experience learning from peers and role models.
                          Everybody has something interesting to say about the lives they live.
                        <li>
                          This relates to digital media because I can potentially upload my own work, a reflection of my peer's work,
                          or reflection of a guest speaker's work online using HTML.
                        <li>
                          This relates to the VT-shaped student because read-outs can be considered student-life opportunities, which
                          are mentioned in the "V" shape. By developing and sharing their work, students observe and attempt to
                          understand one another artistically. Read-outs encourage learning outside of the classroom as
                          students come together and participate in social engagement.

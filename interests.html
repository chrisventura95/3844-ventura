                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Technical writing</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I work as a technical writing intern at Network Infrastructure &amp; Services.
                          I archive documents, give them appropriate labels, and organize them within a wiki database.
                        <li>
                          My internship relates to digital writing because I am creating content and putting it online.
                        <li>
                          My internship relates to the VT-shaped student through the "V" shape, which outlines experiential learning through internships.
                      </ul>
                    <li><b>Creative writing</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I am a creative writer major. When I'm sad about girls, I wrote poetry in a little composition notebook.
                          I also write comedy scripts for the Filipino American Student Association's culture shows.
                        <li>
                          This could relate to digital media because I can potentially upload this content online using HTML.
                        <li>
                          I suppose my creative writing skills might relate to the vertical portion of VT knowledge: departmental/disciplinary strength.
                          Through the creative writing department, I have developed a versatile set of writing skills ranging from poetry to scripts.

                    <li><b>Intramural football</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I gained a lot of weight, so
                          I joined an intramural football team.
                          We are intermediate in co-rec (with women)
                          and beginner in men (without women).
                          We lose a lot.
                        <li>
                          I'm not sure this has much to do with digital media, unless I made a website dedicated
                          to my football experience where I write about defensive plays and upload pictures of football games.
                        <li>
                          Because football has nothing to do with liberal arts, I don't think I can relate it to the VT-shaped student.

                        <li>
                          I spend a lot of money on shoes.
                          Adidas is on a roll with boost technology.
                          One day I'm going to look back on the time and money I spent on shoes, and I'm going to cry.
                        <li>
                          I'm not sure this has much to do with digital media, unless I made a website dedicated
                            to shoe-collecting where I write about shoes and upload pictures of them.

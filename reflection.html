                    <p>Based on Module 1’s assigned readings, I was surprised at how much thought was put
                      into the idea of an all-accessible encyclopedia. Both H.G. Wells in
                      “World Brain” and Vannevar Bush in “As We May Think” accurately predicted
                      the need for transferrable knowledge, and they also predicted technology
                      that wouldn’t exist for another 60 years. Until this semester, I had no idea
                      that scholars valued the role of data archival and data distribution in our
                      society.</p>
                    <p>I was intrigued reading articles about the College of Liberal Arts and
                      Human Sciences utilizing a “VT-shaped student” concept. While I love double
                      majoring in English and Communication, it’s a little overwhelming being around
                      engineers and computer science majors. After reading articles such as
                      “Concepts” from the Beyond Boundaries website, I was amazed at how much was
                      planned for the “VT-shaped student” concept. The article contains huge
                      expectations for students to engage with the community and make big-scale,
                      environmentally friendly, cost-effective ideas that positively impact the
                      world. Learning opportunities outside of the classroom are emphasized so
                      students gain hands-on experience as they promote the Virginia Tech name
                      wherever they go.</p>
                    <p>I felt proud knowing that the liberal arts department focuses their attention on the
                      students’ versatility and ensures that the students acquire a diverse skillset.
                      I’m glad we’re learning how to apply our writing skills to the technology
                      field.</p>
                    <p>At first, building HTML websites was difficult to get used to.
                      It’s repetitive having to open and close brackets after every heading,
                      paragraph, list, etc. Sometimes, I forget all together, and it messes
                      up the entire code. The process of adding a picture and making sure it
                      sizes correctly on the website takes a lot longer than I thought it would.
                      Now that I am completing assignments for Writing and Digital Media,
                      I understand the meticulous steps that are necessary in order to build
                      websites that have concise content and look visually appealing.</p>
                    <p>The feeling after writing long lines of code and checking the website,
                      only to find that the code didn’t work at all, is truly awful. It means
                      I have to go back and look through each line of code again and again to
                      spot the mistake(s). Sometimes, I have to go look up the problem on
                      Google and see if other users have found any solutions. While the process
                      is long, it is ultimately rewarding. Not only am I learning essential
                      coding skills, I am also creating content that I am proud to say is my own.
                      It’s a big step up from Weebly, where I’m simply dragging and dropping
                      text boxes and images. Instead, I am building content from the ground up.</p>
                    <p>All in all, my experience with Module 1 was uncomfortable and repetitious;
                      however, I can honestly say I learned more in these few weeks than I have
                      during the whole semester in some of my other classes. Looking back on how
                      much I have experienced, I cannot wait to see what is in store from future
                      modules and what else I can learn about digital writing.</p>

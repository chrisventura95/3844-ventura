                    <p>Based on the assigned readings for Module 1, I was surprised at how much thought was put into the idea of an all-accessible encyclopedia. Scholars from many years ago were able to accurately predict the need for transferrable knowledge, and they were also able to predict the kind of technology that would come to exist in present day. Until this school year, I had no idea data archival and data distribution played such an essential role in our society.
                    <p>I was also intrigued to read all the articles about the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences utilizing a “VT-shaped student” concept. While I love double majoring in English and Communication, sometimes it is a little overwhelming when I’m around engineers, computer science majors, physics majors, math majors, etc. After reading all the articles, I am excited knowing that the liberal arts department is putting emphasis on their students’ versatility and ensuring that students acquire a diverse skillset. It makes me even more proud of the majors I chose to pursue here at Virginia Tech. In today’s day and age, I’m glad that we are learning how to apply our writing skills in the technology field.
                    <p>Building HTML websites was a little difficult to get used to at first. It is repetitive having to open and close brackets after every title, heading, paragraph, list, and URL link. Sometimes, I forget all together and it messes up the entire code. Additionally, the process of adding a picture and arranging content before and after it takes a lot longer than I thought it would. Now that I am completing assignments for Writing and Digital Media, I can understand the long and meticulous steps that are necessary in order to build websites that not only have concise content but also look visually appealing.
                    <p>The feeling after writing long lines of code and checking the website, only to find that the code didn’t work at all, is truly awful. It means I have to go back and look through each line of code again and again to spot the mistake(s). Sometimes, I have to go look up the problem on Google and see if other users have found any solutions. While the whole process is long, it is definitely rewarding in the end. Not only am I learning more about what it means to code, but I am also creating content that I can be proud to say is my own. It is a big step up from Weebly, where I am simply dragging and dropping text boxes and images. Instead, I am building content from the ground up.
                    <p>All in all, my experience with Module 1 was uncomfortable and repetitious; however, I can honestly say I learned more in these few weeks than I did during the whole semester in some of my other classes. Looking back on how much I have experienced, I cannot wait to see what is in store from future modules and what else I can learn about digital writing.

                    <p>Based on this semester’s assigned readings, I was surprised at how much attention was given to online documentation, the potential of liberal arts students, and critical thought.

                    <p>Regarding historical concepts in documentation, H.G. Wells in “World Brain” and Vannevar Bush in “As We May Think” accurately predicted the need for transferrable knowledge, and they also predicted technology that wouldn’t exist for another 60 years. Until this semester, I had no idea that scholars valued data archival and data distribution in our society.

                    <p>I was intrigued reading articles about the VT-shaped student. It was always overwhelming being around engineering and computer science majors, so it was comforting knowing that the university wanted to focus its attention towards liberal arts students. After reading “Concepts” from the Beyond Boundaries website, I realized there was a lot of expectations set up for liberal arts students; however, I did not completely understand the VT-shaped student concept.

                    <p>Now that the semester has come to an end and I have worked in a team to complete projects centered on V- and T-shaped students, I have gained a better understanding of the VT-shaped student concept. The liberal arts department supports students obtaining as much education as possible, seeking out internships and partnerships in order to help the community, as well as applying humanistic education to technology education so that unique content can be produced. I also realized that the VT-shaped student concept was not as foreign as I thought it to be, as in my four years I was actively pursuing internships and disseminating information online.

                    <p>Regarding HTML, coding was difficult to get used to. It was repetitive opening and closing brackets after every heading, paragraph, list, etc. Sometimes, I forgot all together, and it messed up the entire code. The process of adding a picture and making sure it sized correctly on the website took a lot longer than I thought it would.

                    <p>While the process was long, it was ultimately rewarding. Not only did I learn essential skills, I created content that I was proud to say was my own. It was a big step up from Weebly, where I simply dragged and dropped text boxes and images. Instead, I built content from the ground up.

                    <p>Additionally, the more I used HTML and GitHub, the better I got at it. I didn’t have to Google solutions or watch videos as much as I did earlier in the semester. A lot of concepts became second hand, such as adding pictures and indenting paragraphs. The introduction of Markdown didn’t hurt either, as it was a shorthand way to create content that took twice as long if it was created using HTML.

                    <p>All in all, my experience with Writing and Digital Media was uncomfortable and repetitious; however, I can honestly say I learned more during a week in this class than I learned during the whole semester in some of my other classes. Looking back on how much I have experienced, I cannot wait to utilize my skills as I graduate and apply my knowledge in the real world.
